# Lake-Travis-Latin-Bots
A series of scripts that utilize selenium to perform latin tasks that are based on the stroies of Ritchie. An Aguirre's worst nightmare.

These bots are based on the latin website and latin lexicon as they existed by June of 2022, since I no longer have access to the latin website, I cannot update the bots past their current state; however, the algorithms used in these bots are nearly perfect in accomplishing the tasks givin in the latin website, the only change that may need to be made is changes made to the Xpaths in the latin website, latin lexicon, or the Google search engine. For those who don't have experience in selenium or with HTML, a Xpath is the path identification for an HTML item, the easiest way to find the Xpath of an object is to inspect the HTML file and copy the FULL Xpath(the full xpath is needed for selenium to function as intended).

For those attempting to use these bots without any knowledge of programming or Python, I'd suggest you ask a friend to help you. Python files cannot be executed without dowloading Python, as well as the resepective libraries used in the code, so it is advised you have someone experienced help you with the use of these bots; I would advise against trying to figure out the process of dowloading Python and the needed libraries, as well as executing the code, on your own.

For Lake Travis Latin Students, using my code means you acknowledge the risks; these risks include potential honor code citations and robbing yourself of Latin knowledge. Mrs. Aguirre is not dumb, her major is Computer Science, she can recognize when someone with little Latin skill starts performing abnormally well, as well as having some experience recognizing robitic answer patterns. If you are going to use these bots, I advise it be as a 'last-ditch' effort to pass, and that you use them with some restraint; running the timed vocabulary bot for 12 hours straight is suspicious, believe it or not. 

For those wanting to use my algorithms for their own projects or full translation scripts, feel free, but I do ask that you cite me and my work; these bots compose the culmination of my high school computer science and latin knowledge, I have some pride in them. Their use in another project is an honor, and i'm glad to be of help, but please do credit me.

For other Latin students, these bots are generally not applicable to your assignments, while they are based on Ritchie's texts, they are tailored to the unique way Lake Travis ISD runs its Latin program, some things like the early versions of the noun adjective agreement bot may be of help, but generally I'd advise against it. Using these bots builds a bad foundation for Latin knowledge and can actually cause your grade to suffer in the long run, just do the work. Finally, the same risks apply, these bots can lead to honor code citations.

For those trying to use or modify these scripts, I'm sorry, my documentation habits were lacking in high school, but I do believe the code is structured well enough to figure out what is going on; in addition, everything NEEDS to be dowloaded and the file structure preserved(unless you would like to modify it), the CSV, PNG, and other files are essential to the functionality of these scripts.
